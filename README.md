# password-manager
This is a NodeJS password manager used for storing passwords and encrypting the passwords.
The NodeJS Libraries used are:

Crypto-js: Version 3.1.5 npm install crypto-js@3.1.5

Node-persist: Version 0.0.6

Yargs: Version 3.15.0

This program is to be fully used in the terminal, however I am in the process of building a native or web UI that is more user friendly.
